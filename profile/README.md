Sup, we're pantsudev. We're a ragtag bunch of cool misfits with a slightly twisted taste in interactive cartoons and a compulsive obsession to hone our skills in translation, creative writing and gamehacking. 
Namely, we currently work on `JP` âž§ `EN` localization of *at least one* certain visual novel.

This GitHub organization doesn't contain our actual translations.
It only has repositories for our private tools for hooking and patching/loading, as well as game text import/export.
[@korewayumi](https://github.com/korewayumi) is solely responsible for those; go pester her if you wanna talk tech.
